# Overview
The tool defines 3 primitives which are used to configure a system:

- Modules
- Actions
- Configuration

Different parts of the system are configured by *modules*. Modules use 
*actions* to change the state of the system. Modules also 
accept *configuration*.

# Operating Systems
[Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/) is the only linux distribution supported 
at this time.  

The tool has the concept of actions which allow support for other operating systems to be added.

# Modules
A module has 2 steps:

- Install
    - Configure relevant part of system using actions
- Verify
	- Ensure the expected changes were made by the module

# Actions
Actions modify the state of the system. They abstract how the system's state is actually modified. Allowing modules to 
use actions and let the implementation of the action run different commands depending on the operating system.

# Configuration
Configuration is used by modules to modify their behavior.
